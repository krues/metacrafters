# Token Assignment 
This assignment written in Solidity is the final project for the Beginner course in Metacrafters on Blockchain and Solidity

## Description

The Solidity program is used to create our very own token using a smart contract. The token contains a token name, abbrevation and the total supply. There is also a mapping of addresses with balances. The program also has two functions mint and burn which increases and decreases the balances respectively. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

The program draft is copied from the metacrafters website and onto Remix - an online IDE for Solidity (https://remix.ethereum.org/) and is then edited
